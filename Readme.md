# Design patterns


This repo contains a brief description of the most popular OOP design patterns and implementation examples in Python.
Before diving into the patterns, please consider the following OOP Terminology:

**Inheritance** - an approach when a class inherits properties of another class. The child class is usually a subtype of a base class. 
Example: `User` class is a base class whereas `VIPUser` is an inherited class that might extend properties of `User` with VIP rights. 

**Composition** - composition means that instead of subclassing, one class is included into another class. In terms of composition, 
the child class can't exist without the parent and being created during parent creation. 

**Aggregation** - aggregation also means that instead of subclassing, one class is included into another class. In terms of aggregation, 
the child class has its own lifecycle.

**Interface** - a description of methods that an object must implement. An interface does not contain implementation.
